# E-commerce Sales Dashboard with Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I built an interactive dashboard for a fictional e-commerce company to analyze its sales performance and guide strategic decisions.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Excel (Data source)
- Power BI

## 🗂️ Dataset
Two datasets were used: one containing sales data and another with customer information.

## 🛠️ Key Metrics and Visuals
- Cards for total sales, average customer income, and total orders
- Line charts for monthly sales volume and revenue
- Bar charts for sales by product category, customer age, and income distribution
- Interactive filters (state, sales channel, age group, income group, etc.)

## 💡 Insights
This project reinforced how a well-structured dataset and thoughtful visual storytelling can generate valuable business insights for forecasting and decision-making.
